# Introduction

For our project, we have decided to create a News Site in order for our users to access different resources from other news sites and blogs. In this site you will be greeted
with our logo known as **Lazy Loader's News**, the navbar on the top side of the page will include:

* Home Page
* Search Bar
* Sports Section
* Entertainment Section
* Weather Section

Our users will be able to access through varieties of different articles based on the type of genre the users are interested in. This would help bring more variety in our website, if a section is not available for the users the search section will help users navigate different articles.

# Home Page/Search Bar

You will be introduced to an empty home page to greet users who enters the webpage. This how the normal home page would look when the user enters, just a basic layout to greet
users. However, if user wants to find an article that's not included in the Lazy Loader's News Navbar, the user can use the search bar to find a specific article or genre they 
are looking for. This will fill up the home page with different news articles of the specific interests. The search will be available in every section except for the weather section, and the search will stay on its the chosen section (Not to a seperate HTML Website).
