                      There's never been a benching like the one the coronavirus
                      pandemic delivered to the sports world in 2020. College
                      football, an NFL preseason tradition, the NBA, the MLB,
                      NCAA championship tournaments and even the Little League
                      World Series were all impacted. At least one professional
                      league went bust. Entire seasons were scrapped. Other
                      times, much-anticipated games were irreparably lost due to
                      coronavirus-related schedule revisions. The latter was
                      especially true in college football, where even powerhouse
                      programs such as Alabama, Notre Dame and USC were forced
                      to bow to the realities of the outbreak. Here's a look of
                      the games, events and seasons canceled, postponed or
                      delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our rundown is current
                      as of publication, and notes return dates for seasons and
                      events, where applicable. In March 2020, as the sports
                      world unraveled, the XFL suspended and then canceled its
                      inaugural season. By mid-April 2020, everything was over:
                      The league filed for bankruptcy. In August 2020, Dwayne
                      "The Rock" Johnson was among the investors who purchased
                      the XFL for $15 million. The coronavirus pandemic picked
                      off the Little League World Series on April 29, 2020. The
                      cancellation was the first in the history of the
                      international youth-sports event, traditionally hosted in
                      August in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. On March 24,
                      2020, the International Olympic Committee and host country
                      Japan pushed back the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to an
                      unspecified date -- sometime between "not in 2020," and no
                      later than the summer of 2021. The NFL's counterparts in
                      the Canadian Football League repeatedly pushed back the
                      start of their 2020 regular season before calling off the
                      whole thing on Aug. 17. The Baseball Hall of Fame canceled
                      its Cooperstown induction ceremony, scheduled for July 26,
                      2020. The plan is now to honor the Hall's Class of 2020
                      members, including Derek Jeter (pictured), in July 2021.
                      At that time, the Hall of Fame will also honor its
                      to-be-determined Class of 2021. The College World Series,
                      held annually in Omaha, Nebraska, since 1950, got swept
                      away along with the rest of college spring sports in the
                      spring of 2020. There was no spring practice in 2020 for
                      Clemson's Trevor Lawrence (pictured) or any other NCAA
                      footballer. The annual off-season ritual got nixed in the
                      wake of colleges nationwide moving their students off
                      campus -- and canceling all spring seasons and activities.
                      The Women's College World Series, the premiere softball
                      tournament, held annually in Oklahoma City, went down
                      along with the rest of college spring sports in 2020.
